# Complement CIDR

This is a command line utility to get the complementary set from a CIDR address range.
Basically it converts in binary the original address and for every bit returns the CIDR range with the oppposite value.

## TODOs

- Iet to be tested
- Needs help messages and general improvement from the "UX" (even as a cli)
- Readability of some functions can be improved
